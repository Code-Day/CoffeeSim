Coffee Simulator game for the Android platform

<b>Update:<b/>

It was down to the wire, but we were unable to finish in time to present in the StudentRND Code Day Hackathon.

<i>What we learned...<i>
+ AndEngine is a great tool for game developement! This was our first time using it along with the Box2D physics engine so the exposure we got from that will come in handy for future game developement!
+ Physics is hard... 
+ Making a coffee simulator game does not make you less tired at 6AM.
+ Making coffee DOES make you less tired at 6AM.
+ The Github branch model from nvie.com was very useful! In the beginning we had a couple of issues with branching but this got us back on track with the project. I will use this branching model for future projects.

Over all, this project was a great learning experience for every one in the team. We would like to pick this up where we left off a some point in time. However, developement will slow down due to the hackathon being over. That being said we look forward to picking this up in the future!
